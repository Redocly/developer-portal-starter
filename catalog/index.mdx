# API catalog

Welcome to a sample API catalog.

There are many ways to organize information in Redocly.

This pull request demonstrates:
- separated sidebars
- combined sidebars
- drilldown sidebars

This catalog view is a combination of combined sidebars and separate sidebars.

Select a category such as games, and then select an API.
