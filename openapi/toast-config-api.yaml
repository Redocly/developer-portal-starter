              Toast is streamlining and improving the set of configuration options that restaurants use for configuring where a menu entity is visible (for example, on a Toast POS device or on a restaurant's Toast online ordering website). As part of this change, the `visibility` value in the configuration API has been deprecated. Before 2020-05-25, you should transition to using the `visibility` array that the menus API returns for each menu entity, instead of this `visibility` value, to determine where the entity should be visible.
              See <a href="https://doc.toasttab.com/Ie5QH/apiMenuItemVisibilityAndApiChanges.html">Menu Entity Visibility and API Changes</a> for more information.
