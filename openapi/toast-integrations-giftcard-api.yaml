        Returns gift card transaction information
      description: |
        Provides information about a gift card transaction processed by 
        the Toast platform. The transaction information in the 
        message body is intended to allow a gift card provider to 
        perform corresponding operations on the gift card account, 
        maintained by that provider.
        
        You define the endpoint name for this implementation. The Toast 
        platform makes requests to the REST path that you supply 
        during integration setup.
        
        Each `POST` request to the endpoint includes a 
        `Toast-Transaction-Type` header parameter value to indicate the 
        type of gift card transaction it represents. The possible 
        transaction types are:
        
        * Activate a new gift card.
        * Add value to an active gift card.
        * Get the current balance of a gift card.
        * Redeem value from a gift card, for example for a purchase.
        * Reverse a previous transaction, for example to void a purchase 
          made with the gift card.
        
        The `GiftCardTransaction` 
        object in the message body includes a set of information that 
        is specific for each transaction type.
        
        The response time for a gift card transaction request must be 
        less than 500ms.
        
        All gift card transactions must be considered idempotent. The 
        implementation must handle multiple requests with the same 
        `Toast-Transaction-GUID` *and* the same `giftCardIdentifier`.
