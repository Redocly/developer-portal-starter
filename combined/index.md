# Combined sidebars

This puts multiple APIs into a single visible sidebar.

```yaml
combined:
  - page: combined/index.md
  - page: combined/rock.page.yaml
  - page: combined/paper.page.yaml
  - page: combined/scissors.page.yaml
```

:::note Pagination
We've paginated the rock, paper, and scissors APIs differently as well.
