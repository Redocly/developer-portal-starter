:::info Multiple Payment Methods
You can keep several payment methods on file as long as one card is selected as your "default" payment method.

After adding additional payment methods, you can also make one of them your default at any time.

You can edit an existing payment method by clicking an existing card, updating relevant information, and selecting "Update payment method."

You can also delete additional payment methods (i.e. any payment not set as your default) at any time.
