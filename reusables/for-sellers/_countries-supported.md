Fast supports Sellers listed on the [Fast Pricing page](https://fast.co/pricing). In order to be a Seller with Fast, we must be able to issue a cross-border payment in your country's native currency ([more details here](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/cross-border-payouts)). If you are not in a supported country please reach out to [**seller-support@fast.co**](mailto:seller-support@fast.co).

If you attempt to [onboard as a Seller](https://fast.co/business-sign-up) from an unsupported country, the Seller onboarding process will terminate and you will receive a message thanking you for your interest (though Fast will follow up at a later date once you are eligible to onboard as a Seller).
