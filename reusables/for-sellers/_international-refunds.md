When Fast processes a refund, we refund exactly the amount we received, in the currency that we received. For example, if we processed a transaction for $347.89 USD, we would issue a refund for $347.89 USD. If a customer paid with a card issued in a currency that is different from the transaction currency, the customer's bank will convert the refund amount back into the currency of the card based on prevailing exchange rates. This means that customers who receive refunds from Fast may sometimes receive less or more than the original payment amount shown on their card statement.
