The shipping options presented to the customer are the shipping options you have enabled for your eCommerce platform and will be available to the customer during Fast Checkout's 5-minute checkout window (aka the 5-minute order batching window). During the 5-minute window, the Shopper has the ability to update their shipping method. If no shipping method is selected, the default will be whichever option is least expensive to the customer.

### Minimum Shipping Thresholds

Fast batches orders if a single customer places multiple orders within the 5-minute checkout window, so the final order will include all purchases within that window. Your customer will receive 1 order confirmation that communicates the total cost of the finalized batch order purchase. Your shipping system will also receive 1 order, and can then determine appropriate shipping costs, packaging, and timelines as determined by your shipping system settings.

### Minimum Processing Volume

We do not have a minimum processing volume.
