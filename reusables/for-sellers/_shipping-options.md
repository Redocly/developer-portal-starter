The shipping options presented to the customer are the shipping options you have enabled for your eCommerce platform and will be available to the customer during the checkout process's 5-minute batching window. During the 5-minute batching window, the buyer has the ability to update their shipping method. If no shipping method is selected, the default will be whichever option is least expensive to the customer.

### Minimum Shipping Thresholds

We batch orders if a single customer places multiple orders within a 5-minute window, so the final order will include all purchases within that window. Your customer will receive 1 order confirmation that communicates the total cost of the finalized batch order purchase. Your shipping system will also receive 1 order, and can then determine appropriate shipping costs, packaging, and timelines as determined by your shipping system settings.

### Minimum Processing Volume

We do not have a minimum processing volume.
