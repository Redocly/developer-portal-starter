# Fast Overview and Prerequisites
## Overview
Fast is an application that business owners can connect to their online stores to create quick, efficient checkout experiences for shoppers. Once you have installed Fast into your online store and shoppers have a Fast account, your customers can experience speedy one-click checkouts. For example, shoppers at an online store without Fast capabilities have to fill out a lengthy checkout form. But with Fast, shoppers can buy shoes with one click. This can lead to increased conversion rates for sellers and a better experience for shoppers.
## Prerequisite
To use Fast, as a prerequisite, you need an online store hosted by one of two ecommerce platforms, either BigCommerce or Woocommerce. Alternatively, you can also use Fast if you have an online store that you host with a custom system that your business set up or that you had an independent contractor build. In addition, you also need a bank account for your business. Below are more details about these online store hosting platforms:

**BigCommerce**: This ecommerce platform is an excellent choice for sellers without developer experience who want to focus on selling their products. It’s less customizable than other options.

**WooCommerce**: This ecommerce platform choice works great for sellers with tech skills who want lots of customizable options and plugins to add to their online store. WooCommerce is built directly into WordPress.

**Custom System**: You or someone you worked with might have created a custom system to power your online store, as opposed to using a pre-existing ecommerce platform like BigCommerce or WooCommerce. This option is the most technical, but gives you the most control over your store.
