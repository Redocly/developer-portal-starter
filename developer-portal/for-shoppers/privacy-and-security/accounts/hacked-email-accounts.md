# Hacked Email Accounts

If your email account is compromised, your online identity becomes highly vulnerable to misuse. **Since Fast doesn’t store your email username or password, your email account credentials cannot be compromised by using our services.**

However, if your email address does get compromised, bad actors may attempt to use your Fast account. While we’re always on the lookout for anomalous activity on the platform, please reach out to us if you believe your Fast account or your email account was compromised.

We take account security very seriously and we will work with you to protect your account and remediate any risks.
