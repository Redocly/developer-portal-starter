# Updating Your Payment Method

<img alt="payment method sidebar option"  src="./images/payment-methods.png">

To add a card, log into Buyer Dashboard and click on the Payments icon found in the left navigation panel. Click the "add payment method" button to add your new payment information and youâ€™re good to go! If you want to keep several payment methods on file, you are able to do this as long as one card is selected as your "default". Once you have a payment method selected as the "default" option, you are able to delete any additional credit cards on file.
