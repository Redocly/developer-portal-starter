Fast Checkout enables one-click purchases without requiring a password to log in. You only need to sign in once on a given device, and Fast will remember account and payment information, without compromising security.

When you see a Fast Checkout button on your favorite website and have already signed up for Fast, press the button and your order is confirmed. There’s no need to add items to a cart. We’ll process your payment and get your order ready to go!
