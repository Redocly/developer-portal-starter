# Emails Related To Your Order

## Email types + related emails

Thanks for using Fast to place an order! Depending on the status of your order (successful or cancelled), you will receive several emails with subject lines as follows:

### Successful Order Emails

1. Fast Order Processing
2. Fast Product Added
3. Fast Order Processing (second email sent to reflect a price change, e.g., discount code applied)
4. Fast Order Shipped
5. Fast Order Out for Delivery
6. Fast Order Delivered

### Cancelled Order (User cancelled order)

1. Fast Order Processing
2. Fast Product Added
3. Fast Order Cancelled

### Cancelled Order (Payment declined)

1. Fast Order Processing
2. Fast Product Added
3. Fast Order Cancelled

## Email Troubleshooting:

### If you add a discount code after clicking “Checkout”

If you add a discount code after clicking “Checkout”, you:

- **Won’t** see the updated (discounted) price in the first Order Processing email.
- **Will** see this updated (discounted) price reflected in the second Order Processing email.

We apologize for any inconvenience.

Additionally, you will:

- not receive a second Order Processing email to confirm an address update
- see the updated address reflected in your order details in the [Fast Shopper Dashboard](https://fast.co).

### Order is cancelled

If your order is cancelled for any other reason, Fast Customer Support will reach out to let you know.

### You don't recieve any confirmation emails

If you do not receive confirmation emails, please check that you saved the correct email address in the ["Address" tab of the Fast Shopper Dashboard](https://fast.co/profile/address). If your email is incorrect in the dashboard, please update it and reach out to Fast Customer Support at [hi@fast.co](mailto:hi@fast.co) to confirm your payments were processed.
