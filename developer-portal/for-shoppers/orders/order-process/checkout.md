Fast Checkout enables one-click purchases without requiring a password to log in. You only need to sign in once on a given device, and Fast will remember account and payment information, without compromising security.

When you see a Fast Checkout button on your favorite website and have already signed up for Fast, press the button and your order is confirmed. There’s no need to add items to a cart. We’ll process your payment and get your order ready to go!

# The 5 minute checkout window

This is a confirmation page where customers can confirm their details on their Fast account, select shipping options, and add discount codes if needed.

Fast will default to the cheapest shipping option available. Also, if a customer places another order with the same merchant/seller within the 5-min checkout window, they will not be charged again for shipping!

## Things you can do (during the 5 minute checkout window)

You can

- **Cancel your order** during this time.
- **End the 5 minute checkout window early**.
- **Press Done**.
- **Do nothing**. If nothing is done and the 5 minutes expires, the order will begin processing. Customers will receive an email confirmation once the button is clicked, and a cancellation email if the order is cancelled within the 5 minute window.

## Once the 5 minutes have passed

Fast is unable to edit or cancel orders once placed. If you need to edit or cancel an existing order, please reach out to the seller to do so.
