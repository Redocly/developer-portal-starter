## Reorders

Within your Fast Dashboard if you click on a previously purchased item there will be a 'Buy Again' option. This feature allows you to reorder items directly from the Buyer Dashboard! Simply select the item and click 'Buy Again'!

It's important to mention the item will be re-purchased at the current price listed on the sellers website. You will have a 5 minute grace period to view the total amount, cancel your order, or make an update to your order details.
