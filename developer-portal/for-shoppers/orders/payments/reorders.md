## Reorders

You can reorder items directly from the [Fast Shopper Dashboard](https://fast.co) by selecting a previously purchased item and clicking the "Buy Again" option!

It's important to mention the item will be re-purchased at the current price listed on the Seller's website. You will have the standard 5-minute grace period to view the total amount, cancel your order, or make an update to your order details.
