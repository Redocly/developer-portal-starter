## During the 5-minute checkout window

During the 5-minute checkout window you have the ability to update your payment method to a different option that is listed in your dashboard or you can add a new one during the 5-minute window. If a payment option is not added or selected, the payment method chosen will be your "default" card in your dashboard.

It's important to mention that updating your credit card information is only reflected on future orders. Payment methods can not be updated on current orders, if you need to update your payment details on a current order please contact the merchant directly.
