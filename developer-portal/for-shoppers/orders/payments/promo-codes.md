# Promo Codes

## Where do I put a promo code?

You can use promo codes in the pop-up Order Confirmation page:

1. Click "Edit Order"

   <img alt="order confirmation page" src="./images/promo1.png"/>

2. Click "Add Coupon Code"

   <img alt="order confirmation page Add Coupon Code button" src="./images/promo2.png"/>

3. Click "Apply"

   <img alt="order confirmation page coupon code form" src="./images/promo3.png"/>

## Promo Code Confirmation

You will receive confirmation of the discounted price you paid in your 2nd "Order Processing" email, to accommodate any edits made during the 5 minute batching window.
