## Case Studies

### BarnDoor Ag

**Delivering a simple checkout solution for all customers**

Fast's simplicity was instantly appealing to the Oklahoma-based agricultural equipment seller BarnDoor Ag. Within a week of installing Fast Checkout, Barndoor Ag saw a 27% surge in checkout conversion, with 20% of all sales being processed through Fast, and an average order value of $200. Barndoor's product page checkouts also went from 0% to 80%, because Fast is the only checkout solution that lives right on the product page, helping drive incremental sales that might have not otherwise occurred.
