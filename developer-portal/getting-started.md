# Getting started with **Redocly Portal**

This page lists steps to install and run the **Portal**.

### Before you begin ###

Before installing the **Redocly Portal**, make sure to do the following:

* Install [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable). These package managers work across all the major operating systems).
* Know how to run the commands from the CLI (for example, `yarn install`). For Windows, we recommend using Git Bash.
* Know the [basic git techniques](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/start-using-git.html) (creating a branch, committing, and in our examples, opening a pull request on GitHub.)
* Get familiar with Markdown. We recommend using the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) application to manage your files.
