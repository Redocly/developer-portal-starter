*Tip: You can deactivate plugins to troubleshoot website issues. Slowly deactivate them one-by-one, each time checking to see if the error persists. If you find one plugin is the problem, visit their changelog or website for latest news or updates. Also ensure all of your plugins are always up-to-date.*

### Configure Fast plugin settings
Now that you activated the plugin, you can click the Fast plugin link now shown in the left side admin navigation (towards the bottom usually), to navigate to the plugin settings window.

Direct url to your plugin settings is `http://yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=fast`

#### Add your App ID
Copy your App ID from your seller dashboard and enter it into the App ID field in the Fast plugin settings. Scroll down and click Save Changes at the bottom.

*Tip: You can copy & paste your App ID from the seller dashboard to your WordPress website so you don't have to re-type it all. Use your mouse to highlight the text. Navigate to edit in your menu bar, then click Copy. Navigate back to your WordPress admin dashboard and click into the App ID field. Go to edit again, but this time, click Paste.*

#### Test functionality and review appearance of Fast buttons
Test the following pages and functions of your website to ensure Fast is integrated properly, as well as appears the way you would like it to appear.

* Product page `https://yourwebsite.com/product/PRODUCT-NAME`
* Cart page `https://yourwebsite.com/cart`
* Checkout page `https://yourwebsite.com/checkout`
* Mini cart `varies depending on theme`
* Login page `https://yourwebsite.com/my-account`

If your site is still in test mode, you can place orders without risk. [See Stripe's basic test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) to find test credit card numbers you can use for orders.

#### Edit the appearance of the Fast button
You can also edit the default CSS of the Fast button in this area. See the [Customizations](#customizations) section to learn more about customizing these fields. 

## Turn off test mode
Once you have tested the various sections where Fast is integrated, you're ready to turn off test mode! Navigate back to the Fast plugin settings page in your WordPress admin dashboard, scroll below the CSS boxes, then uncheck test mode, and scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.
