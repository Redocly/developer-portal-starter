# Using MDX

Use MDX by naming the file extension as `.mdx` and importing the components at the top of the file.

You can import a single extension:
```jsx
import { RedocResponse } from '@redocly/ui';
```
Or multiple extensions at the same time:

```jsx
import {
  Box,
  Button,
  FlexSection,
  Flex,
  Jumbotron,
  H1,
  H2,
  Link,
  ThinTile,
  WideTile,
  Emphasis,
  SectionHeader,
 } from '@redocly/ui';
```

We created a library (`@redocly/ui`) with components you can reference.

Try and create an MDX file which renders one of your API's response objects.

With Samples Panel:
```html
<RedocResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" />
```
<RedocResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" />

Without Samples Panel:

```html
<RedocResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" hideSamples={true} />
```
<RedocResponse definitionId="petstore" pointer="#/components/responses/PetResponse" hideSamples={true} />


## Other components

What other components would you like to see?  Let us know.  We're adding new components.

## Developing new components

A developer familiar with React can create new components.
We left a sample component at `/components/Counter.tsx`.
Inspect it and its usage at `/developer-portal/custom-component.mdx`.
