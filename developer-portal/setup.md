# Install the developer portal

## Clone

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Redocly/developer-portal-starter.git

cd developer-portal-starter
```

## Install dependencies

Before you start... you'll need node and yarn installed.
- [node.js >= 10.15.1](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

```bash
yarn install
```

<div class="attention">
Depending on your operating system, you may see warnings when installing dependencies.
</div>

## Start the development environment

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will start a development server.
Most functionality exists in the development server except for search.
When the server is ready, the url will be published to the console.
It may default to http://localhost:3000.
Open that in a browser to see this developer portal load.

## Stop the development environment

Press control and c.

## Clearing cache

<div class="warning">
Troubleshooting? Try this out.
</div>

A few changes (such as changing the key of a sidebar definition) require clearing cache to reflect in the local server.
We actively reduce these to make the best development environment experience possible.

1. Press control-c.
1. Run `yarn clean` in the command prompt to clear the cache.
1. Run `yarn start` again.
