1. On [fast.co/business](https://www.fast.co/business), enter the following information and click “Next:”

   - Your preferred email address (You can add additional email addresses for access later.)
   - Your first name and your last name (If your business has multiple employees, you can add more people later and give those people various levels of access and permissions.)

   **Note**: Fast doesn’t use passwords. We use PIN numbers instead.
