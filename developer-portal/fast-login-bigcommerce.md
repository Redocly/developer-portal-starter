# FAQ

## How do you update an existing organization?
When in the seller dashboard onboarding, select ‚ÄúExisting Org‚Äù. You should then be able to see your organization in the dropdown. You may now add an existing app to your organization.

## My store doesn‚Äôt use an ecommerce platform. Can I still use Fast?
Yes, see the custom login integration information [here.](/developer-portal/fast-login-install)

## I am using a BigCommerce store. How can I make sure Fast uses my registered store email?
When you log into a BigCommerce store, if you have a BigCommerce account associated with that email address, we will use the same account. Otherwise we will create a new BigCommerce account for you. No effort required on your part.

## I use more than one email. Do I need to make multiple Fast accounts?
No - You can add an additional email to your account by going to any currently logged in site and adding your other email. Once you have successfully resolved the pin challenge this email will now be associated with your account.

## How long is my login active?
Your login session will be active for at minimum 1 calendar month, and increases by one calendar month with each additional login.
