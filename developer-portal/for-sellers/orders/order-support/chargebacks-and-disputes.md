# Chargebacks and Disputes

 We know that fraud is a major pain point for online merchants — and we don’t think you should have to deal with it. As part of Fast's [**Zero Fraud Guarantee**](/developer-portal/for-sellers/orders/order-support/zero-fraud-guarantee/), you’re covered for all of your transactions processed through Fast. You can focus on running your business, and let Fast handle the fraud dispute process, while keeping you informed as needed.

\*Connected Sellers will still be liable for service disputes and related fees, and will be notified by the Fast team as part of our existing dispute investigation and representment operational process.
