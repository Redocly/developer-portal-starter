# Cancelled orders

Orders may be cancelled by Fast for a variety of reasons:

- Payment declined
- No inventory
- Shipping or billing address is incomplete
- Selected shipping option is not available

If an order is cancelled due to payment or items out of stock, etc. Fast will reach out to the customer directly. You should not fulfill the order, but you may see the order appear in your Seller Dashboard as a payment decline and in your eCommerce platform as a cancelled order.
