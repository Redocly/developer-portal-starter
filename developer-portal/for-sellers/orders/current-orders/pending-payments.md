You can view pending payments in your store's dashboard provided by your eCommerce platform (i.e. not in your Fast Seller Dashboard).

A status of "Pending payment" indicates that the customer's cart has been abandoned for less than 1 hour. If the customer's cart has been abandoned for 1 hour, the order will be marked as abandoned in our backend system and will disappear from your Orders view.
