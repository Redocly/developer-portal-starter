# Purchasing Multiple Items

Fast batches multiple transactions made by a single customer within the 5-minute checkout window, in order to not affect your AOV or increase shipping costs. All orders placed within the 5-minute checkout window will compile into one large batched order for processing by sellers, whose system will determine appropriate shipping costs and times for the items in the order. If customers purchase an additional item within that 5 minutes, the timer then resets.

::: attention Seller Agreement Fixed Fee
Please note that each payment will incur the fixed fee as set forth in the applicable Seller agreement (which is primarily a fee that Fast pays to relevant banks). However, this fee can be offset by a lift in conversion and sales via Fast Checkout.
