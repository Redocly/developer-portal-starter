# Purchasing Multiple Items

We batch multiple transactions made by a single customer within a 5 minute window, in order to not affect your AOV or increase shipping costs. All orders placed within a 5 minute window will compile into one large batched order for processing by sellers, whose system will determine appropriate shipping costs and times for the items in the order. If customers purchase an additional item within 5 minutes, the 5-minute timer then resets.

> Please note, each payment will incur the fixed fee as set forth in the applicable seller agreement; which is primarily a fee that Fast pays to the banks. However, this fee can be offset by a lift in conversion and sales via Fast checkout.
