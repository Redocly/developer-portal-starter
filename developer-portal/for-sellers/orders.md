# Orders and Payments with Fast

Ah, the money! It’s our favorite part too: watching our sellers’ revenue climb as Fast as you can install Fast Checkout.

Here you’ll learn more about understanding payments, payouts, refunding orders, fulfilling orders, store credit, international orders, and more. Sellers love our Zero-Fraud Guarantee, so be sure to click that link, too!

## Overview

We promise it’s easy to understand, but if you have any questions, we’re here to help, so reach out!

Once a Shopper completes a Fast Checkout, the order with Fast should become visible both in [the "Payments" tab of the Fast Seller Dashboard](https://fast.co/business/dash/payments) and within the Orders section of your e-commerce platform.
