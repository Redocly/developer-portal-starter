# Fast Seller Quickstart

:::info Note

We’re here to help at any stage of the process, so if you run into any confusion or have any questions, reach out to us at [**seller-support@fast.co**](mailto:seller-support@fast.co)

:::

Seller onboarding is incredibly important to us — the process of enabling Fast Checkout everywhere you can to increase your revenue should should be both easy and enjoyable.

## Requirements

For many Sellers, the simplest setup to start using Fast will involve an integration with an online store hosted by a [supported eCommerce platform](/developer-portal/for-developers/platforms).

Alternatively, you can also use Fast via a [custom API integration](/developer-portal/for-developers/custom-integration) with your online store. This option is the most technical, but gives you the most control over your store.

The rest of the requirements are covered in our ["Will Fast Work For Me"](/developer-portal/for-sellers/quickstart/preinstall/will-fast-work-for-me/) Section.

## Becoming a Seller with Fast

The first step to integrating Fast Checkout with your store is to [**become a Seller on Fast.co →**](https://www.fast.co/business-sign-up).

### Onboarding Summary

The Seller Onboarding process will require you to:

- provide details about your organization
- provide integration details for your online storefront (e.g. if your store's website domain is hosted by a supported eCommerce platform or if you will need to do a custom integration)
- complete technical integration steps to connect your store to Fast
- verify your business
- confirm banking details
- complete other onboarding tasks.

## Looking Ahead

**Fast is constantly working to integrate with additional eCommerce platforms**. If your store runs on an eCommerce platform not listed among our [supported platforms](/developer-portal/for-developers/platforms/), talk to one of our representatives using this [form](https://fast.co/contact-sales). We may still be able to help you.

And **stay tuned as we add more eCommerce platform integrations**. Check out the [Fast Newsroom](https://www.fast.co/newsroom/news) and [Fast’s Twitter](https://twitter.com/fast) for updates.
