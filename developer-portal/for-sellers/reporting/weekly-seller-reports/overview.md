| **Fast Merchant Volume (FMV)** | This is the amount of money from orders that were placed via Fast Checkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Fast Transactions**          | This is the total number of orders placed via Fast Checkout. This number includes both orders placed through shopping cart and on product detail pages.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)**  | This is the average value of the orders placed through Fast Checkout. This is calculated by dividing FMV/Fast transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **PDP Percent**                | This is the percentage of transactions that are completed on your product detail pages. The higher this percentage, the lower your AOV may be. If you haven't already we recommend placing our button on your product pages as Fast Checkout is the only checkout solution for your product pages that drives incremental sales. |
| **Share of Wallet**            | The percentage of all your transactions that go through Fast Checkout. The higher the percentage, the more your customers are using Fast Checkout as their preferred or only method of payment.                                                                                                                                  |
