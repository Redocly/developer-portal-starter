# Fast Checkout

!["Fast Checkout Button"](/images/fastcheckoutbutton.svg)

We're thrilled to have you onboard as a Fast Seller! To help proactively answer questions your customers may have about Fast we've compiled a list of frequently asked questions. Please feel free to copy and paste the information below into a help center article on your website or wherever you feel most appropriate.

## What is Fast Checkout?

Fast Checkout enables one-click purchases without requiring a password to log in. You only need to sign in once on a given device, and Fast will remember your account and payment information, without compromising security.

When you see a Fast Checkout button on your favorite website and have already signed up for Fast, press the button and your order is confirmed. There’s no need to add items to a cart. We’ll process your payment and get your order ready to go!

## What happens when I press “Fast Checkout?”

If you haven't used Fast before, you'll fill out a first-time checkout form. After filling out this form once, you'll have a true one-click checkout experience anytime you press Fast Checkout!

If you’ve used Fast before, press Fast Checkout and your order will be processed. You can update order details after clicking Fast Checkout, and you'll have 5 minutes to cancel or add to your order. After 5 minutes, Fast will go ahead and complete your order.

## What is the 5-minute checkout window?

This is a confirmation page where customers can confirm their details on their Fast account, select shipping options, and add discount codes if needed. Fast will default to the cheapest shipping option available. Also, if a customer places another order on the website within the 5-min checkout window, they will not be charged again for shipping!

The customer can cancel their order during this time or press done to begin processing. If nothing is done and the 5 minutes expire, the order will begin processing. Customers will receive an email confirmation once the button is clicked, and a cancellation email if the order is cancelled within the 5 minute window.

**Fast is unable to edit or cancel orders once placed**. If you need to edit or cancel an existing order, please reach out us here [YOUR WEBSITE NAME/CONTACT INFORMATION] directly to do so.
