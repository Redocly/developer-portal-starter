## What if the Seller has multiple businesses/stores to onboard?

There can be multiple stores created under a single organization. The first time you create a new Organization, you will be asked to also create a new store. Each subsequent store can then be onboarded under the existing Organization by going to the top right drop-down of the Dashboard at [**fast.co/business/dash/home**](https://fast.co/business/dash/home) and selecting “Create New App/Store” and following the steps in the UI.

## How to Assign and Transfer Ownership of an Organization

Partners who have completed onboarding on behalf of Sellers can transfer ownership of the Organization to the Seller using the “Teams” functionality. Here are the steps:

- **Go to [**fast.co/business/dash/home**](https://fast.co/business/dash/home)**
- **Log in** using the email that you onboarded the Seller’s organization with (if you’re not already logged in)
- **Make sure that you have the right store selected** by verifying the store name in the top right corner of the dashboard. Any store under the organization you want to transfer will work
- **Go to the “Teams” option on the left navigation bar**
- **Click “Add Team Member”**
- **Add the email and first and last name**of the person you want to transfer ownership to on the Seller side. Make sure you select “Owner” for their role and then click “Send Invite”
  > That person should now receive an invite via email which they need to accept and confirm on our website by authorizing a ping challenge
- **Verify with that person that they can see their store(s)** on [**fast.co/business/dash/home**](https://fast.co/business/dash/home)
  > **Optional**: If the new Owner wishes, they can go to “Teams” on the left navigation bar and deactivate the Partner’s user access to their dashboard
