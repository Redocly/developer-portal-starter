8. **Confirm that the copy you just made is active**.
   > To do this, look at where it says “Current Theme” and make sure that underneath that, it has the name of your backup copy. It might also have a word like “light” or “warm.” If, for any reason, the copy is not active, reach out to the Customer Success team for help at **seller-support@fast.co**.
