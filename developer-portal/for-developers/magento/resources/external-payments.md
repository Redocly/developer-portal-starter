# Capturing Payments Outside of Magento

**If your current integration does not create invoices in Magento as part of the capture process**, you’ll need to communicate with Fast directly from the system capturing payments:

Similarly, **if your order fulfillment flow doesn’t send shipment or refund updates to Magento**, you will need to integrate your Order Management System directly with Fast.
