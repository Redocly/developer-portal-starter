# Install Step 4: Activate your Storefront

When you activate your Magento store, this will update Fast with information about your store so that customers can checkout.

**In order to move to production, you’ll need Fast to issue production credentials**. These are granted once Fast has reviewed your sandbox installation and confirmed that it’s configured properly. After activating in production, you’re ready to begin accepting Fast orders through your store.
