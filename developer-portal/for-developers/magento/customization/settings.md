# Custom Settings

## Add-ons

If you have a product that relies on add-ons (e.g. “we recommend you buy sku-xyz with sku-abc”) that doesn’t rely on grouped or bundled products from Magento, you’ll need to extend the provided Module to customize the Fast checkout button based on the Group Products type (which involves passing multiple products to Fast as a collection of simple SKUs when customers click the Fast Checkout Button).

Bundled products are currently not supported for Fast Checkout.
