# Install Step 4: Activate your Storefront

**In order to move to production, you’ll need Fast to issue production credentials**. These are granted once Fast has reviewed your sandbox installation and confirmed that it’s configured properly. After activating in production, you’re ready to begin accepting Fast orders through your store.

When you activate your SFCC store, this will update Fast with information about your store so that customers can checkout.
