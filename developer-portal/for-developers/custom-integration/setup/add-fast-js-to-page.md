```

### Use the Fast Checkout Button - Programatic/Advanced Approach

Decide where you want the button to appear on your product page and add a container for it:

```html
<fast-checkout-button></fast-checkout-button>
```

When the button is clicked, use fast.js to place an order for the item. Make sure to include any product-specific options:

```jsx
// If you have multiple fast-checkout-button elements on a single page, you'll want to use a more specific selector
// here, such as giving each button an id attribute and selecting based off of that.
var checkoutButton = document.querySelector("fast-checkout-button");
checkoutButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  Fast.checkout({
    // Required. appId is your Fast app ID that you were provided during seller onboarding.
    appId: "my-fast-app-id",

    // Required. buttonId is the id attribute of the button that was clicked
    // after an order was placed or canceled, as well as let you identify which button was clicked when listening for
    // postMessage events.
    // If you gave your fast-checkout-button an id attribute, then you can just use event.target.id here.
    buttonId: event.target.id,

    // Either cartId or products must be provided. If both or neither are provided, an error will be thrown before
    // checkout is opened.

    // When performing a cart checkout, you only need to provide buttonId and cartId.
    // cartId is a unique identifier for a user's cart.
    cartId: "my-unique-cart-id",

    // When performing a products checkout, you only need to provide buttonId and products. You can also optionally
    // provide couponCode and affiliateInfo
    // products is a list of products the user is ordering.
    products: [
      {
        // Each product has an identifier, a variant identifier, and, optionally, a set of configurations (called
        // options) that are used to describe the exact product being ordered.
        // You can think of the id as the product SKU, the variant ID as a sub-identifier to the product, and the
        // options as things like color, size, etc. Or, if your product identifiers already define exactly one
        // product, you can just use id and forgo providing options.
        // The data provided here is what will reach your backend, so describe your products however makes the most
        // sense to you.
        // Required. id is an identifier for the product being ordered
        id: "my-product-id",
        // Optional. variantId represents a unique sub-idenfifier for this product. These are sometimes used to
        // denote size / color, etc.
        variantId: "my-large-product-variant-id",
        // Optional. options is a set of configurations that further describe the product being ordered (e.g. color
        // and size).
        options: [
          {
            // Required. id is the name of the option.
            id: "color",
            // Required. value is the value of the option.
            value: "blue",
          },
        ],
        // Required. quantity is the number of this product with these configurations being ordered.
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
    // Optional. couponCode is a coupon that the user might have entered that you would like to pass on to your
    // backend.
    couponCode: "10OFF",
    // Optional. affiliateInfo contains information about affiliates that you would like to attribute this purchase
    // with on your backend.
    affiliateInfo: {
      // affiliateInfo contains a single field named affiliates, that is an array of affiliate objects.
      affiliates: [
        // An affiliate object contains a single field named id, which is a unique identifier associated with this
        // affiliate. This ID can be whatever string your system is prepared to interpret.
        { id: "my-affiliate" },
      ],
    },
  });
});
```

:::info heads up
ðŸš¨ It is important that you call `Fast.checkout` synchronously within the `click` event handler. Many browsers will block new windows like Fast Checkout unless they are clearly connected to a user action such as clicking a button. If you perform asynchronous logic that takes several seconds, or call checkout in code in a different frame or window, the browser will prevent Fast Checkout from opening.
:::

## Handle events from Fast Checkout

**Once the user has clicked the Fast Checkout button, the Fast popup window will have launched and the user can continue with their checkout**. While this is going on, you can listen for fast.js `postMessage` events if you want to keep up with the status of the order on your frontend.

You can read more about about fast.js events in the [fast.js documenation](/developer-portal/for-developers/custom-integration/fast-api/events/).
