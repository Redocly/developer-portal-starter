# Handle Fast iOS SDK Events

The Fast SDK will send events that convey information about the user's shopping journey through the Fast checkout flow. The SDK will communicate with the seller app via callbacks as the user performs actions within the checkout flow.

### Callbacks

Each callback will include a `FastEvent` parameter. No action is required by your app when these events are fired--they are purely for transparency within the checkout flow.

### FastEvent

A `FastEvent` is emitted by the SDK at key stages during the checkout flow. Your app can handle these via the checkout `callback` parameter.

| Name                  | Type                      | Description                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `FastEvent`           | NSObject                  | An enum describing the event.                 |
| `FastEvent.eventType` | `FastEventType`           | An enum describing the event.                 |
| `FastEvent.info`      | [`FastEventInfoKey`: Any] | Additional relevant data regarding the event. |

### FastEventType

Each `FastEvent` will have an associated `FastEventType` and associated data payload. A breakdown of event types can be found below.

| Event            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Associated Data |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `orderCreated`   | Emitted when the order has been successfully submitted through Fast Checkout.                                                                                                                                                                  | PurchaseInfo    |
| `orderUpdated`   | Emitted when buyer updates the order (e.g. changes item quantity, removes an item, or adds a coupon).                                                                                                                                          | PurchaseInfo    |
| `orderCompleted` | Emitted when order is finalized. This means that the batching window has ended and the user cannot update the order. If the user closes the SDK before batching window has ended, you won't get this event and instead get the `closed` event. | PurchaseInfo    |
| `orderCancelled` | Emitted when user cancels the order.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | PurchaseInfo    |
| `orderFailed`    | Emitted when checkout fails with an error                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Error           |
| `closed`         | Buyer has exited the Fast iOS SDK                                                                                                                                                                                                              | None            |

:::info Associated Data Returned by Non-Order Events

Please note that non-order events will have different associated data.

- `orderFailed` (indicating a checkout failure) emits an `Error`.
- `closed` should emit no additional data at this time.

:::

```swift
/// The outcome of the Fast checkout flow.
public enum FastEventType: Int {
  /// Emitted when the order has been submitted through Fast Checkout.
  case orderCreated = 0
  /// Emitted when the order has changed while inside the Fast Checkout.
  case orderUpdated = 1
  /// Emitted when the order has been finalized from inside Fast Checkout,
  /// either when the post-purchase order batching window times out or
  /// when Fast Checkout is manually dismissed.
  case orderCompleted = 2
  /// Emitted when the order has been cancelled from inside Fast Checkout
  case orderCancelled = 3
  /// Emitted when checkout has failed with an error.
  case orderFailed = 4
  /// Emitted at SDK exit
  case closed = 5
}
```

### FastEventInfoKey

An enum describing a parameter from within the `FastEvent` payload, which currently describes either `purchaseInfo` or `error`.

```swift
public enum FastEventInfoKey: String {
  case error
  case purchaseInfo
}
```
