The Fast Android SDK allows you to securely collect payments natively through your Android app. If you want to collect in-app payments for services like digital subscriptions or digital goods, we encourage you to read the [Google Play Payments Policy for in-app purchases](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en).
