# Handle Fast Android SDK Events

The Fast SDK will send events that convey information about the user's shopping journey through the Fast checkout flow. The SDK will communicate with the seller app via callbacks as the user performs actions within the checkout flow.

## Callbacks

As the user progresses through the Fast checkout experience, callbacks will notify your app about significant events. You can listen for these events by passing in a callback object. You will need to define the method in your activity / fragment to listen to callbacks.

```kotlin
private fun onFastCheckoutEvent(event: FastCheckoutEvent) {
    when (event) {
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCanceled -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCanceled: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCompleted -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCompleted: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderCreated -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderCreated: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderFailed -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderFailed: ${event.throwable}")
        }
        is FastCheckoutEvent.OrderUpdated -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: OrderUpdated: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        FastCheckoutEvent.SDKClosed -> {
            Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: SDKClosed: ${event.purchaseInfo}")
        }
        // Please keep this else clause. Fast may add more events in the future without updating the SDK's major version.
        else -> Log.i(LOG_TAG, "Event: Unhandled event: $event")
    }
}
```

### FastCheckoutEvent

A `FastCheckoutEvent` is emitted by the SDK at key stages during the checkout flow. Your app can handle these via the `onFastCheckoutEvent()` function.

| Name                             | Type                | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FastCheckoutEvent`              | `Parcelable` object | Additional relevant data regarding the event.                                                                                                    |
| `FastCheckoutEvent.purchaseInfo` | `PurchaseInfo`      | Additional relevant data regarding the event. Refer to [PurchaseInfo Data Class Breakdown](#purchaseinfo-data-class-breakdown) for more details. |

### FastCheckoutEvent Types

The `FastCheckoutEvent` contains these events and associated data payloads.

| Event            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Associated Data |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `OrderCreated`   | Emitted when the order has been successfully submitted through Fast Checkout.                                                                                                                                                                   | `PurchaseInfo`  |
| `OrderUpdated`   | Emitted when buyer updates order information like item quantity, removes an item, or adds a coupon.                                                                                                                                             | `PurchaseInfo`  |
| `OrderCompleted` | Emitted when order is finalized. This means that the batching window has ended and the user cannot update the order. If the user closes the SDK before batching window has ended, you won't get this event and instead get the SDKClosed event. | `PurchaseInfo`  |
| `OrderCanceled`  | Emitted when user cancels the order.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `PurchaseInfo`  |
| `OrderFailed`    | Emitted when checkout fails with an error                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Throwable?      |
| `SDKClosed`      | Buyer has exited the Fast Android SDK. If buyer exits post-purchase, `PurchaseInfo` will be sent with the event. If buyer exits before clicking on CompletePurchase, `null` will be sent with the event.                                        | `PurchaseInfo`  |

:::info Associated Data Returned by Non-Order Events

Please note that non-order events will have different associated data.

- `OrderFailed` (indicating a checkout failure) emits a `Throwable?`, which is a nullable `kotlin.Throwable` object that wraps an error.
- `SDKClosed` will usually emit no additional data, but can emit `PurchaseInfo` data if the SDK is closed following a successful order (similar to the `OrderCompleted` event).
