# Use the Fast -> Seller API

Fast uses a non-standard, polymorphic API. As our product grows and changes, many new features will be added to the API. As such, we have built it in such a way that buyer's may opt-in to new features with minimal friction. Fast will communicate with your server application on these endpoints.
