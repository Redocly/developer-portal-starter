## Use Cases

Below are business use cases that will trigger Fast to call the Read operation to the Seller.

<details><summary><h3>Read a Cart</h3></summary>
<p>

### Read a Cart

Fast makes a read request to the existing platform cart so that it can get the item information to create a Fast order. This call is triggered when a user clicks the Fast Checkout button from the mini-cart or cart page.

**Request**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadRequest_Order_Cart"
/>

**Response**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadResponse_Order_Cart"
/>

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Read an Order</h3></summary>
<p>

### Read an Order

Fast makes a read request to an existing order to retrieve the order information. Seller->Fast API communication within the Order Management Service triggers a request to read an order.

**Request**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadRequest_Order"
/>

**Response**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadResponse_Order"
/>

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Read a Shipping Zone</h3></summary>
<p>

### Read a Shipping Zone

Fast makes this call to check for any restricted countries so that error messaging can show immediately when a shopper tries to ship somewhere invalid. That way, restricted countries or states/provinces are sent to Fast early in the process.

This is triggered when a shopper enters or changes a shipping address on their Fast order.

**Request**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadRequest_ShippingZone"
/>

**Response**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/ReadResponse_ShippingZone"
/>
