# Delete Operation

The Delete operation is called to clear carts from either Fast or the eCommerce platform in cases such as order cancellation prior to placement, cart abandonment, or initiating a Fast checkout from a platform cart page.

## Delete Request

<span>
  <p
    style={{
      fontFamily: "Courier,monospace",
      display: "flex",
      alignItems: "center",
    }}

    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "cadetblue",

    /fast/v1/delete
  </p>
</span>
<OpenApiRequestBody
  definitionId="merchant"

## Delete Response

**The response to delete should be empty if no issues occurred**, or return [one of the listed error codes](../../../../resources/error-codes) in the case something went wrong.

### Success (200)

{}
```

### Error

<OpenApiResponse
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/responses/DefaultResponse"

## Use Cases

Below are business cases that will trigger Fast to call the Delete operation to the Seller.

<details><summary><h3>Delete a Fast Cart</h3></summary>
<p>

### Delete a Fast Cart

If a Shopper chooses to cancel their order, the pending cart will be deleted.

For anonymous / first-time Fast Shoppers that don't complete their profile or make order updates for an hour, Fast will consider it an abandoned cart and send a request to clear the cart from the eCommerce platform

If a Shopper initiates Fast checkout from the platform cart page, we make a call to delete the platform cart upon successful Fast order creation (but not timing window complete) to avoid duplicate orders. This will include the platform cart id in the external_order_id field to distinguish between a request to delete the Fast Checkout cart.

**Request**

<OpenApiExample
  definitionId="merchant"
  pointer="#/components/examples/DeleteRequest_Order_Fast_Cart"
/>

**Response**

```json
{}
```
