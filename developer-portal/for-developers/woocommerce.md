The Fast Checkout button lets your customers check out in seconds, with just one click. No passwords, no hassle. If it's a customer's first time using Fast, they'll be guided through a simple one-page form that creates a Fast account for them and enables 1-click checkout for their next purchase.

### Payments & Orders

When a customer purchases a product from your store using Fast Checkout, Fast accepts and processes payments on your behalf and submits an order once the transaction has been approved by the card issuer.
