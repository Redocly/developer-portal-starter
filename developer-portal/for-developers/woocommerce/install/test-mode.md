## Step 2: Test Mode

1. Click the “Test Mode” tab.
   **By default, your store will be in test mode**. We recommend you keep the store in test mode by keeping the “Enable test mode” button checked. This way, only you and other store admins will see the Fast buttons.

   **Once you are ready to make the Fast buttons go live to the public, you can uncheck “Enable test mode” and the buttons will be visible to everyone on your site.**

| **Test Mode**                      | If you want shoppers to see the changes you made to the online store’s styling, uncheck “Enable test mode” and then click “Save Changes.” Now, everyone can see the Fast buttons.                                                                                                               |
| **Debug Mode**                     | Enables you to log messages within the Fast plugin. If you are a developer looking to troubleshoot issues, you can check the debug mode checkbox to do that. If you check this, click “Save Changes” afterwards.                                                                                |
| **Disabled Multicurrency Support** | Can be used to disable multicurrency support. This is only necessary if you do not need to support multicurrency in the Fast checkout process and the store uses a third-party multicurrency plugin to handle multicurrency in WooCommerce. If you check this, click “Save Changes” afterwards. |
