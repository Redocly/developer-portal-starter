Here is what each option shows, as seen in the above image:

:::info Additional Options

After initial plugin installation, you can come back to the Options tab to specify additional custom settings (e.g. hiding the Fast button for certain products or specifying a custom post-checkout redirect page). For now, you can just proceed with the rest of the plugin installation steps. You can find more details in the ["Options Tab" section WooCommerce Custom Settings page](/developer-portal/for-developers/woocommerce/customization/custom-settings#options-tab).
