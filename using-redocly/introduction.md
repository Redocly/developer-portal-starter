### Terms and definitions ###
Before you start working with **Redocly Portal**, we recommend getting familiar with the following terms and definitions:

- **OpenAPI Specification** (formerly Swagger Specification) – an API description format for REST APIs.

- **API documentation portal** – a place that provides all necessary documentation related to the API.  

- **Single source of truth** – a practice of structuring the information models and associated data schema such that every data element is mastered (or edited) in only one place.

- **Markdown** – a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.
- **Markdown extensions** – Markdown extensions allow you to extend and enhance the Markdown preview. This includes changing the look of the preview or adding support for new Markdown syntax.
- **React components** – building blocks of any React app. A component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI (User Interface) should appear.
