#### Credits

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.

Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.

### Stuff used to make this:

* [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) for Markdown parsing
* [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
* [highlight.js](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/) for syntax highlighting in output code blocks
* [js-deflate](https://github.com/dankogai/js-deflate) for gzipping of data to make it fit in URLs
